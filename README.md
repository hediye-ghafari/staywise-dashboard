## StayWise⭐

StayWise is a modern hotel management dashboard built with React. The project is inspired by and originally based on The Wild Oasis project by Jonas Schmedtmann, and has been fully personalized, extended, and refined with additional features, improvements, and architectural enhancements.

This project demonstrates my ability to take an existing production-style codebase and evolve it into a personalized, scalable, and maintainable application.

This project is designed as a portfolio-grade React application, showcasing real-world architecture, advanced state management, API integration, and clean UI patterns.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

React
React Router – routing & navigation
React Query (TanStack Query) – server state & data fetching
Supabase – backend, authentication & database
UI, Styling & UX
Styled Components – component-level styling
Framer Motion – animations
Recharts – data visualization
React Icons – icon library
Forms & Utilities
React Hook Form – form handling & validation
date-fns – date manipulation

## Architecture & Patterns 🧠

This project follows clean and scalable React architecture, inspired by industry best practices:
Compound Component Pattern (as used in Jonas's original project)
Custom Hooks for reusable logic
Separation of concerns between UI, logic, and data fetching
Feature-based folder structure
Declarative data fetching with React Query

## Environment Variables 🔐

Create a .env file in the root directory and add:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

## Personalization & Enhancements 🔧

Compared to the original The Wild Oasis project by Jonas Schmedtmann, this version includes:
Renamed and rebranded the project as StayWise
UI refinements and personalized styling
Additional animations using Framer Motion
Improved UX details
Extended usage of utility libraries
Code refactoring for readability, scalability, and maintainability
Added responsive layouts for all major screens
